# 42_exam_03_training

This repository contains my solutions for the 42 School exam_03.  
You may be asked to do :   
- ft_printf
or  
- get_next_line  
 
Here are my solutions to these two problems.   
(I validated old exam_02 w/ ft_print and exam_03 w/ get_next_line)  
Feel free to have a look at it but please practice before the exam in order to learn how the logic works :)
